# Hospital Platform

## About the Project

Our hospital platform is a comprehensive solution for managing healthcare services, connecting patients with doctors, and facilitating seamless appointments and consultations. The platform offers a range of services across various medical specialties, each accompanied by a list of qualified doctors.

Users can easily browse through the services and doctors available, viewing detailed information about each doctor, including their experience, specialization, and reviews from other patients. To schedule an appointment, users must first create an account and log in, ensuring a secure and personalized experience.

After scheduling an appointment, users can leave reviews based on their experience with the doctor, helping other patients make informed decisions. Additionally, logged-in users can utilize the "Ask the Doctor" section to seek advice or clarification on medical issues, with responses provided exclusively by our team of expert administrators.

Admin users have the privilege of adding new services to the platform, ensuring that the latest medical treatments and specialties are always available to patients. They can also add new doctors, ensuring that the platform's database remains up-to-date and comprehensive.
